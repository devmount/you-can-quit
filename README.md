This app is a tool to track your progress and encourage you on the way of quitting a bad habit. In a simple calendar view, you can set past days _successful_ or _failed_. Based on this data, you can see encouraging stats about the number of days you succeeded in. Plus you can earn special achievements to reach different goals and keep you motivated on your way.

**you**-**c**an-**q**uit in short: **UCQ**, which also means (if you pronounce it): You Seek You. It's about you, making an impact on your own life.

This web app is based on Vue.js and Dexie.js.

> ℹ This app values privacy. The data isn't meant to be synchronized between different devices, therefore local browser storage (IndexedDB) is used to store your data. However you have the possibility to export your data and import it on another browser or device.

## Get started

Just head over to <https://youcanqu.it> and start your journey.

## Build it yourself

1. Get all files

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devmount/you-can-quit
    ```

2. Install all dependencies using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

    ```bash
    cd you-can-quit
    yarn
    ```

3. Run the app by ...

    ... either run the `you-can-quit/dist/index.html` in your browser, e.g.

    ```bash
    firefox dist/index.html&
    ```

    ... or start the development server with hot reload at localhost:8080

    ```bash
    yarn serve
    ```

    ... or make the production build with minification yourself

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

## Upgrade from 0.x to 1.x

The breaking change in version 1.x is, that the database was switched from Firebase to IndexedDB. This means, it's no longer compatible with your current data. If you rather want to migrate your data instead of starting from scratch (depends on how much days you already used this app), you can do the following:

1. Export your Firebase data into a local `.json` file in the following format:

    ```json
    {
      "2019-02-02": 1,
      "2019-07-25": -1,
      "2019-01-10": -1,
      "2019-11-09": 1
    }
    ```

    The order of dates doesn't matter. If you have any problems to do so, please [create an issue](https://github.com/devmount/you-can-quit/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

2. Update app files and dependencies

    ```bash
    cd you-can-quit
    git pull
    yarn
    ```

3. Run the app (see instructions above in the *Get started* section) and import this data file in the administration section at the bottom.
