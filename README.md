# you-can-quit

A tool to track your habits and support your progress in quitting whatever your vice or addiction is. In a simple calendar view, you can mark past days as _successful_ or _failed_. Based on your selection, you can see encouraging stats about the number of days you succeeded. Plus you can earn special achievements to reach different goals and keep you motivated on your way.

This web app is based on Vue.js and Firebase/Firestore and is _currently in development_.

## Get started

1. Get all files

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devmount/you-can-quit
    ```

2. Install all dependencies using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

    ```bash
    cd you-can-quit
    yarn
    ```

3. Create an empty file called `config.js` in `you-can-quit/src`

    ```bash
    touch src/config.js
    ```

4. Log in to your [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com) and hit the "Create new project" button
5. Enter your new project and click "Add Firebase to your web app"
6. Copy the following code into your just created `config.js`. Replace the values with those of your Firebase project

    ```javascript
    export const config = {
      apiKey: "<your-api-key>",
      authDomain: "<your-auth-domain>",
      databaseURL: "<your-database-url>",
      projectId: "<your-project-id>",
      storageBucket: "<your-storage-bucket>",
      messagingSenderId: "<your-messaging-sender-id>"
    }
    ```

7. Either start the development server with hot reload at localhost:8080 ...

    ```bash
    yarn serve
    ```

8. ... or create a production build with minification

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
